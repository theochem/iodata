    r"""Compute overlap matrix for the given molecular basis set(s).

    .. math::
        \braket{\psi_{i}}{\psi_{j}}

    When only one basis set is given, the overlap matrix of that basis (with
    itself) is computed. If a second basis set (with its atomic coordinates) is
    provided, the overlap between the two basis sets is computed.

    This function takes into account the requested order of the basis functions
    in ``obasis0.conventions`` (and ``obasis1.conventions``). Note that only L2
    normalized primitives are supported at the moment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obasis0
        The orbital basis set.
    atcoords0
        The atomic Cartesian coordinates (including those of ghost atoms).
    obasis1
        An optional second orbital basis set.
    atcoords1
        An optional second array with atomic Cartesian coordinates
        (including those of ghost atoms).

    Returns
    -------
    overlap
        The matrix with overlap integrals, ``shape=(obasis0.nbasis, obasis1.nbasis)``.
