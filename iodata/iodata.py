class IOData:
    """A container class for data loaded from (or to be written to) a file.

    In principle, the constructor accepts any keyword argument, which is
    stored as an attribute. All attributes are optional. Attributes can be
    set are removed after the IOData instance is constructed. The following
    attributes are supported by at least one of the io formats:

    Attributes
    ----------
    atcharges
        A dictionary where keys are names of charge definitions and values are
        arrays with atomic charges (size N).
    atcoords
        A (N, 3) float array with Cartesian coordinates of the atoms.
    atcorenums
        A (N,) float array with pseudo-potential core charges. The matrix
        elements corresponding to ghost atoms are zero.
    atffparams
        A dictionary with arrays of atomic force field parameters (typically
        non-bonded). Keys include 'charges', 'vdw_radii', 'sigmas', 'epsilons',
        'alphas' (atomic polarizabilities), 'c6s', 'c8s', 'c10s', 'buck_as',
        'buck_bs', 'lj_as', 'core_charges', 'valence_charges', 'valence_widths',
        etc. Not all of them have to be present, depending on the use case.
    atfrozen
        A (N,) bool array with frozen atoms. (All atoms are free if this
        attribute is not set.)
    atgradient
        A (N, 3) float array with the first derivatives of the energy w.r.t.
        Cartesian atomic displacements.
    athessian
        A (3*N, 3*N) array containing the energy Hessian w.r.t Cartesian atomic
        displacements.
    atmasses
        A (N,) float array with atomic masses
    atnums
        A (N,) int vector with the atomic numbers.
    basisdef
        A basis set definition, i.e. a dictionary whose keys are symbols (of
        chemical elements), atomic numbers (similar to previous, str to make
        distinction with following) or an atom index (integer referring to a
        specific atom in a molecule). The format of the values is to be decided
        when implementing a load function for basis set definitions.
    bonds
        An (nbond, 3) array with the list of covalent bonds. Each row represents
        one bond and consists of three integers: first atom index (starting
        from zero), second atom index & an optional bond type (0: not known, 1:
        single, 2: double, 3: triple, 4: conjugated).
    cellvecs
        A (NP, 3) array containing the (real-space) cell vectors describing
        periodic boundary conditions. A single vector corresponds to a 1D cell,
        e.g. for a wire. Two vectors describe a 2D cell, e.g. for a membrane.
        Three vectors describe a 3D cell, e.g. a crystalline solid.
    charge
        The net charge of the system.
    core_energy
        The Hartree-Fock energy due to the core orbitals
    cube
        An instance of Cube, describing the volumetric data from a cube (or
        similar) file.
    energy
        The total energy (electronic + nn)
    extcharges
        Array with values of external charges, with shape (nextcharge, 4). First
        three columns for Cartesian X, Y and Z coordinates, last column for the
        actual charge.
    extra
        A dictionary with additional data loaded from a file. Any data which
        cannot be assigned to the other attributes belongs here. It may be
        decided in future to move some of the results from this dictionary to
        IOData attributes, with a more final name.
    g_rot
        The rotational symmetry number of the molecule.
    lot
        The level of theory used to compute the orbitals (and other properties).
    mo
        An instance of MolecularOrbitals.
    moments
        A dictionary with electrostatic multipole moments. Keys are (angmom,
        kind) tuples where angmom is an integer for the angular momentum and
        kind is 'c' for Cartesian or 'p' for pure functions (only for angmom >=
        2). The corresponding values are 1D numpy arrays. The order of the
        components of the multipole moments follows the HORTON2_CONVENTIONS from
        iodata/basis.py
    nelec
        The number of electrons.
    obasis
        An OrderedDict containing parameters to instantiate a GOBasis class.
    obasis_name
        A name or DOI describing the basis set used for the orbitals in the
        mo attribute (if applicable). Should be consistent with
        www.basissetexchange.org.
    one_ints
        Dictionary where keys are names and values are numpy arrays with
        one-body operators, typically integrals of a one-body operator
        with a pair of (Gaussian) basis functions. Names can start with ``olp``
        (overlap), ``kin`` (kinetic energy), ``na`` (nuclear attraction),
        ``core`` (core hamiltonian), etc. When relevant, these names must have a
        suffix ``_ao`` or ``_mo`` to clarify in which basis the integrals are
        computed. ``_ao`` is used to denote integrals in a non-orthogonal
        (atomic orbital) basis. ``_mo`` is used to denote an orthogonal
        (molecular orbital) basis. For the overlap integrals, this suffix can be
        omitted because it is only useful to compute them in the atomic-orbital
        basis.
    one_rdms
        Dictionary where keys are names and values are one-particle density
        matrices. Names can be ``scf``, ``post_scf``, ``scf_spin``,
        ``post_scf_spin``. These matrices are always expressed in the AO basis.
    run_type
        The type of calculation that lead to the results stored in IOData, e.g.
        'energy', 'energy_force', 'opt', 'freq', ...
    spinpol
        The spin polarization. By default, its value is derived from the
        molecular orbitals (mo attribute), as abs(nalpha - nbeta). In this case,
        spinpol cannot be set. When no molecular orbitals are present, this
        attribute can be set.
    title
         A suitable name for the data.
    two_ints
        Dictionary where keys are names and values are numpy arrays with
        two-body operators, typically integrals of two-body operator
        with four of (Gaussian) basis functions. Names can start with ``er``
        (electron repulsion) or ``two`` (general pairswise interaction). When
        relevant, these names must have a suffix ``_ao`` or ``_mo`` to clarify
        in which basis the integrals are computed, see one_ints for more
        details. Array indexes are in physicist's notation.
    two_rdms
        Dictionary where keys are names and values are two-particle density
        matrices. Names can be ``post_scf`` or ``post_scf_spin``. These matrices
        are always expressed in the AO basis. Array indexes are in physicist's
        notation.
